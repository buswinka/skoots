    "## Detailed Installation\n",
    "To install hcat, ensure you that **Python Version 3.10** as well as all dependencies properly installed. It is recommended\n",
    "to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution of python with a dedicated environment. To do a recommended install,\n",
    "please use the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Download the Anaconda distribution of python from the following link: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). This will install\n",
    "python for you! There is **no need** to install python from an additional source.\n",
    "2) On Windows, launch the `Anaconda Prompt` application. On Mac or Linux launch a new `terminal`. If installed correctly you\n",
    "should see `(base)` to the left of your terminal input. This is your anaconda `environemnt`.\n",
    "3) To avoid dependency issues, we will create a new environment to install skoots. This acts like an isolated sandbox where\n",
    "we can install specific `versions` of necessary software. To do this, in the prompt, type `conda create -n skoots python=3.10` and type `y` when asked.\n",
    "This creates an environment to install our software. We must now activate this environment to\n",
    "access our isolated sandbox and install `skoots`.\n",
    "4) To activate our environment, type in the terminal `conda activate skoots`. Notice how `(base)` has been replaced with `(skoots)`.\n",
    "5) To run hcat we first need to install `pytorch`, a deep learning library. To do this, follow the instructions on the\n",
    "[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) website for your particular system. It is recommended to use these install settings:\n",
